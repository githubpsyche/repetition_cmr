    "Sixty-six students studied and attempted free recall of 15 different lists of high-frequency nouns drawn from the Toronto Noun Pool (Friendly, Franklin, Hoffman, & Rubin, 1982). The lists consisted of 30 words, each repeated three times for a total of 90 presentations per list. List\n",
    "presentation was auditory, and the subjects made their responses\n",
    "vocally into a headset microphone. The words were presented at a rate\n",
    "of 1.5 sec. After list presentation, the subjects were given a distractor task\n",
    "involving simple arithmetic problems of the form A  B  C  ?.\n",
    "The subjects had to correctly answer 15 problems in a row before\n",
    "they could proceed to the recall phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were three list types: massed, spaced short, and spaced\n",
    "long. In the massed lists, each word was repeated three times successively. In the spaced-short lists, the presentation order was randomized, subject to the constraint that the lag between repetitions\n",
    "was at least 2 and no more than 6. For the spaced-long lists, presentation order was randomized, subject to the constraint that interrepetition lags were at least 6 and not more than 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "As is typical in free recall studies, we took mea-sures to eliminate warm-up effects by excluding the first 2 lists\n",
    "from our data analyses. One of these first 2 practice lists was massed,\n",
    "and the other was randomly chosen to be either spaced short or\n",
    "spaced long. Of the subsequent 12 lists, 4 were massed, 4 were\n",
    "spaced short, and 4 were spaced long, presented in an individually\n",
