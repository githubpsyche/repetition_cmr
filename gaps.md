in repfr archives:

keep (but refactor)...
Generalization_Report
CMR-DE (the specification is valuable, I think)
Alternative_Contiguity_Test.ipynb
Without_Delay_Drift_Rate

Clear Gaps:
Statistic-Based Fitting
Likelihood-Based Fitting With PFR, Termination excluded as factors
model characterization for cmr-de

in compmemlearn:
howakaha05.ipynb
lohnas2014.ipynb
model characterization
Trace-Reinstatement_CMR (for writing up mechanism...)

somewhere else:
lag-connectivity analysis and MFF derivation

***

What don't I have that I need to start:
Analyses for HowaKaha05 besides Alt-Contiguity
Sister analyses for DRC effect

What I've started that I'm sure I want to finish:
Literature review that leaves the Lohnas2014 island.
Neighbor Transition Analysis
CMR-DE

What I need to clean up but have at least gotten results for:
Generalization Tests
HowaKaha05 Alt contiguity
Clean Spacing Effect Fit and Critique
Statistic-Based Fitting to Repetition Effects*

Biggest gaps (necessary for small version of project where I just cover effect):
HowaKaha05 analyses
CMR-DE

Hidden gap:
Why are these the options? Dissection of Model Deficiencies and Potential Improvements.
Relate back to CMR!
