Retrieved-context theory (RCT) explains spacing and repetition effects in free recall in terms of contextual variability and study-phase retrieval [@lohnas2014retrieved]. 
Here, though, we present evidence of gaps in this account.
We applied likelihood-based fitting [@morton2016predictive] to a computational model embodying RCT [CMR; @polyn2009context] using previously collected datasets [@lohnas2014retrieved; @kahana2005spacing]. 
Across datasets, CMR poorly generalized between task conditions that included or excluded item repetitions in study lists and underpredicted the mnemonic benefit of spaced repetition.
Participants also exhibited a deficient repetition contiguity effect after recalling an item presented repeatedly in a list. 
They transitioned more often to neighbors of the item's initial, rather than successive, presentation position.
CMR could not account for this pattern, even after adding mechanisms to either suppress memory for items' successive presentations or enhance memory for neighbors of items' initial presentations. 
These results help clarify the challenges presented by spacing and repetition effects for theories of memory.
