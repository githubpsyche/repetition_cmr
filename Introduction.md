## Introduction

First, start with a review of the spacing effect and then of associated effects.

Then bring up the explanations proposed for it across the literature: contextual variability, study-phase retrieval, deficient processing.

Review work relating retrieved context theory to two of these accounts, and outline the main gaps we'll be addressing. The original paper focused on showing how CMR realizes the contextual variability and study-phase retrieval effect mechanisms and illustrating similar patterns in their own dataset. But while the work showed model mechanisms can generate some benchmark repetition and spacing phenomena, model fitting was not performed that would evaluate its ability to account for patterns of retrieval across free recall of lists with item repetitions. This potentially obscures any hidden inconsistencies in the retrieved-context account.

Provide high-level overview of how we address this gap in the literature through model fitting and simulation, novel behavioral analyses, inspection of model representations, and evaluation of accommodative mechanisms. Compared to abstract, we can go into enough detail to clarify what we mean and contextualize our direction with literature. 

And a high-level overview of what we found, what we think this means, and what this meaning would implies.
